## File Sorter

I made the code to sort my downloads folder, I set it to run whenever I boot my computer this helps keeps files sorted and easy to navigate.
A simple file sorter, uses extensions to sort into separate files.


## Instructions

- Install python 3
- Run Download_Sorter.py
- Program outputs should sort all the files into grouped folders

## Help

	If you have issues, 
	Message on the github page
	
	But the code should work fine
